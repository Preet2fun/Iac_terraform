we can provide input variables using below methods to terraform

1) using export variable (for example TF_VAR_filename="/root/abc.txt") 
2) by creating terraform.tfvar variable file
3) by creating variable.auto.tfvar variable file
4) by applying command line variable (for example terraform apply -var "filename="/root/abc.txt")

if terraform get same variable from different source as mention above then it will give priority in reverse order
they mention above (i.e env var have lowest priority where as commnd line as highest priority)
